# W04 · Checklist

### Setup
- [ ] Virtual environment created and activated.
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`numpy`, `openai`, `faiss-cpu`, `qdrant-client`).
- [ ] `env/requirements.txt` generated and committed.

### Understanding
- [ ] Watched 3Blue1Brown video on high-dimensional vectors.
- [ ] Read Jay Alammar’s Illustrated Word2Vec post.

### Exercises
- [ ] `01_basic_embeddings.py` generates embeddings and computes cosine similarity.
- [ ] Similarity check works for king/queen/man/woman analogy.
- [ ] `02_semantic_search.py` builds a mini in-memory search engine and returns top-k docs.
- [ ] `03_vector_store.py` builds FAISS index and retrieves similar vectors.
- [ ] `03_vector_store.py` connects to Qdrant and tested insert/query.

### Consolidation
- [ ] Answered all questions in `04_conceptual_questions.md`.
- [ ] **Self-eval:** I can explain in plain words:
  - What embeddings represent.
  - Why cosine similarity is used.
  - Why vector stores are necessary.
  - The difference between keyword search and semantic search.
